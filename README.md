# MyShop

Myshop is an online store where user can buy the product by simply entering the product details, also they will get discounts on the products if they meet the discount condition. 





## Tech Stack 

I have created MyShop Application in two Programming Languages: 

-> Python 

-> JavaScript

## Approch Used to Solve the Problem
 Divide And Conqure 
     
    First, I have Divided the problem statement into sub-problems
    like: 
        -> First we have to show the product list 
        -> Then we have to take the order details
        -> After tacking the order details we need to process the data and make it in a structured way 
        -> Then we need to calculate the discount amount   
        -> After that we have to print the order summary  

    And then I solved each sub-problem and implemented it as functions and after that, I combined all the functions.  


## How it works 

The MyShop application works in below manner:

    -> When we will start the application all the available products will be prompted in the sacreen>
    -> Then we have to enter how many products we want to buy 
    -> After that we will get the option to enter the product name
    -> Number of units we want to buy and whether we need to wrap them in gift paper or not
    -> After that the application will calculate all the details including the discount also 
    -> Then it will prompt the Oder summary at the end of the program
